Intro
 - Probabilistic LP: surveys (Kersting & De Readt, Roth)
 -- approach 1: MLNs, PSL. 
 --- one binary random variable per atomic formula
 --- factors between random variables that produce a distribution (eg, ground clause)
 --- downside: size of graph, inference cost for MLNs
 - approach 2: restrict to probabilistic inference deductive closure of theory: ProbLog, SLPs, ProPPR
 -- still one binary random variable per atomic formula
 --- used in SLP and ProPPR to define joint distribution indirectly
 --- used in ProbLog and Sucio's probabilistic DBs (cite) to compute probabilities more directly
 -- downside: need to explore full space of proofs, since typically all proofs influence truth/falsity
