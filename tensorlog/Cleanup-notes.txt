Cleanup:
 - clean up mutil: densify
 - clean up dataset: matrix examples (done?) and proppr nonsense (move proppr to extras)
 - clean up funs, ops: refactor bprop and eval into 'native'
 - clean up program: autoweighting, ProPPRProgram vs program

__init__.py
test (2k lines)
  benchmark.py
  testtensorlog.py
  testxcomp.py
core: (maybe 2k lines)
  bpcompiler.py
  comline.py - should add my super simple option holder
  config.py
  dataset.py
  declare.py - do I really need something so complicated as a Goal?
  funs.py - a lot is backprop or eval
  masterconfig.py
  matrixdb.py
  ops.py - a lot is backprop or eval
  parser.py - 200 lines and do I need it?
  program.py - autoweighting
  symtab.py - should start at 0 or 1? do I need reserved words?
  simple.py
  tensorflowxcomp.py - *Function, *Grad, runExpt and support is test, this is a few hundred lines
  theanoxcomp.py - *Function, *Grad, runExpt and support is test
  xcomp.py - *Function, ...
  opfunutil.py - scratchpad crap
extra (200)
  interp.py
  list.py
native (1500)
  learn.py
  debug.py
  expt.py
  plearn.py
  putil.py
  mutil.py - shuffleRows, selectRows used in dataset only; stack, numRows and checkCSR a lot; mapData a lot,
    mostly for clipping; but it's ony 300 lines or so
