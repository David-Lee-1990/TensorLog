Simple TODO's:
 - verify tensorlog works on matrix input, not just single rows
 - tensorlog CLI
 - cache matrixdb transposes 
 - program.maxdepth parameter
 - test sparsity of theano stuff
 - scalability test - compare to real prolog?

Learning/training:
 - textcat toy w/o incoming chains
 - some KBC task
 - some binary predicate tuning task

Bugs:
 - p(X,X) isn't handled correctly.  should I split j=0 into (0,'i') and (0,'o') in the factor graph?

Think thru: 
 - blocks

 - embeddings 

 - unary predicates or binary predicates with a constant (what's the inferred mode for those?)

 - pairs: possibly impossible to do as a gradient.  (note that for classification all I need is
   pair(X,c,Z) which could be done by just constructing the proper matrix in matrixdb),
   or even with pair_with_c(X,Z)

  - oneHot analysis

  - for theano, do envir's need to include some sort of prefix to keep the var namespaces apart?
