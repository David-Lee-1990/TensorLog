tutorial/docs

configuration:
 - think thru how to do this, it's ok if it's done in python,
 so maybe a global config.Config dictionary is fine
 - might want some sort of documentation/typechecking in parallel with the config dict?

more experiments:
 - representation learning/recommendation

clean up experiments
 - numeric stability checks

real learning
 - serializable multi-task datasets
 - adagrad & holdout set for convergence
 - multithreading

extensions:
 - typed relations/predicates
 - multi-input literals and "one-hot" propagation
 - non-linearities:
 mlp(X,Y) :- 
    w1(X,Z1),bias1(B1),biasedSigmoid(B1,Z1,A1),
    w2(A1,Z2),bias2(B2),biasedSigmoid(B2,Z2,Y).

integration w/ theano, tensorflow, ...

implement some sort of structure learning

compare to other languages
 - yap prolog
 - problog2, in more detail
 - some ddb system?
