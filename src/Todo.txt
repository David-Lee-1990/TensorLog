configuration: see config.py

 - might want to include, in tlog, an overall configuration which includes
 the others as subconfigurations.  also might want to serialize/deserialize,
 maybe in json?

debugging:
 - printf(id,X,Y) literal - with ops.conf.printf params on what's output?

more experiments:
 - representation learning/recommendation

clean up experiments
 - numeric stability checks

real learning
 - serializable multi-task datasets
  propprExamplesAsData(db,fileName): convert to provide (xdict,ydict) outputs
 - adagrad & holdout set for convergence
 - multithreading

extensions:
 - typed relations/predicates
 - multi-input literals and "one-hot" propagation
 - non-linearities:
 mlp(X,Y) :- 
    w1(X,Z1),bias1(B1),biasedSigmoid(B1,Z1,A1),
    w2(A1,Z2),bias2(B2),biasedSigmoid(B2,Z2,Y).

integration w/ theano, tensorflow, ...

implement some sort of structure learning

compare to other languages
 - yap prolog
 - problog2, in more detail
 - some ddb system?
