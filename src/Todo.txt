  see docs/README.txt

BUGS: 

 - weights should work with a sparse parameter vector
 - cora fails with optimize_component_multiply turned on
 - csc_matrixes seem to cause unpredictable behavior, should
 double check these in optimized sections 
 - head p(X,X) doesn't work

CLEANUPS:
 - clean up experiments to use expv2 and clean out the dead code

DESIGN FLAWS: 1 fails but 2 is ok even tho both are polytrees.

 1 p(X,Y) :- q(X,X1),r(Y,Y1),s(X1,Y1)
 2 p(X,Y) :- q(X,X1),s(X1,Y1),r(Y,Y1)

EXTENSIONS:

config:
 - might want to include, in config.py, an overall 'top' configuration
 which includes the others as subconfigurations.  also might want to
 serialize/deserialize them.

learning:
 - serializable multi-task datasets
  propprExamplesAsData(db,fileName): convert to provide (xdict,ydict) outputs
 - adagrad & holdout set for convergence
 - multithreading

MORE EXPERIMENTS:

 - Rose's representation learning/recommendation
 - SSL
